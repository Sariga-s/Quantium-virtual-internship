# Quantium-virtual-internship
This repository is a collection of all the solutions of tasks that were assigned to me during my Data Analytics Virtual Internship Experience Program at Quantium. 

// The programming language used is  : python//

Three tasks were assigned for this program. In task 1, the key areas of focus was on data cleaning, data mining and Data visualisation.
## Two data sets were given
1. Transaction data
2. Customer data 
3. 
Given below are the key areas of focus.

Examine transaction data 
Look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. 

Examine customer data 
Check for similar issues in the customer data, look for nulls and  merge the transaction and customer data. 

Data analysis and customer segments 
Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights you find. In the analysis make sure to  define the metrics â€“ look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. 

Deep dive into customer segments 
Define recommendation from our insights, determine which segments we should be targeting and conclude based on the analysis.
